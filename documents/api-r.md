# Spacetime Documentation

The main objective of the spacetime R package is to make tasks like loading, rescaling, merging, and conducting mathmatical operations on spatiotemporal (or other D-dimensional data sets) easier for the user by providing a set of concise yet powerful functions. Spacetime opperations utilize a cube-like structure for all data sets that makes storing and manipulating large D-dimensional datasets more efficient. For scientists working with spatiotemporal data (such as climate or weather data sets) spacetime is an ideal platform that allows the user to focus on the science rather than the coding. Spacetime is in the beta stage (version number = 0.0.1) and additional functionality will be added on a regular basis. The current functionality of spacetime is below:


## Spacetime Objects:


### `fileObj.methods():`
**Description:**  File objects are the output of the `read_data()` fucntion. They are essentially a list object of all the raster files that were read in. All methods of a file object result in a list of outputs (one for each raster in the object). File objects can contain rasters of various scales, time lengths, and sizes. The functions `raster_scale()` and `raster_align()` may be used on file objects to return a file object that contains aligned and trimmed rasters.		
**General output of methods:** A list of output objects of the length of the list of raster objects loaded by `read_data()`.		

* `get_GDAL_data()` - Extracts GDAL data object			
* `get_epsg_code()` - extracts spatial reference system EPSG code				
* `get_units()`	- extracts units of spatial grid	
* `get_UL_corner()`	- Extracts lat and long coords of the upper left corner	
* `get_band_number()` - Extracts the number of bands		
* `change_time(start, stop, interval)` - Changes the time values associated with bands
	* start = (int or list)	of starting time/date/year 
	* start = (int or list)	of ending time/date/year
	* interval = (numeric) interval between times
* `get_time()` - extracts time values (default = 0-N)		
* `get_dims()` - Extracts raster x and y dimensions				
* `get_nodata_value()` - returns no data values		
* `get_data_array()` - get full raster data set as numpy array		
* `get_bands(min=1, max=2, rasters = [0])` get subset of raster data as numpy array
	* min = (int >= 1) first raster band to extract
	* max = (int <= number of bands) last raster band to extract
	* rasters = (list) list of rasters (0-number of rasters) to pull from	 
* `get_lat()` - get latitude values		
* `get_lon()` - get longitude values		

```python
# extract list of raster data cubes from file object
dataArray = ds.get_data_array()

```




### `cubeObj.methods():`
**Description:**  Cube objects are the main operational unit in the spacetime package. Cube objects are cleaned, aligned D-dimensioal cube-liek datasets that minamally contain a data cube, a time dimension, and latitude and longitude (y, x) dimensions. They are the output of the `make_cube()` function. Cube objects may be passed to functions like `cube_smasher()`, `cube_plotter()` etc. to be opperated on mathmatically or functionally and visulized.
**General output of methods:** The associated value for the cube object as specified by the method.		

* `get_GDAL_data()` - Extracts orignal data object			
* `get_epsg_code()` - extracts spatial reference system EPSG code				
* `get_units()`	- extracts units of spatial grid	
* `get_UL_corner()`	- Extracts lat and long coords of the upper left corner	
* `get_band_number()` - Extracts the number of bands		
* `get_time()` - extracts time values
			
* `get_dims()` - Extracts raster x and y dimensions				
* `get_nodata_value()` - returns no data values		
* `get_data_array(variables)` - return a full D-dimensional raster data set as an xarray dataArray. 
	* variables = selects variables to return if cube was created with the "filestovar" option. Takes a list of character string variable names. 				 
* `get_lat()` - get latitude values		
* `get_lon()` - get longitude values

*  `get_var_names()` - get the variable names of the cube		

```python
# extract latitude dimension from cube object
lat = ds.get_lat()

```
