## Using spacetime in Kaggle


### Step 1: Create an account
First, create a free Kaggle acount. [Create a Kaggle Acount](https://www.kaggle.com/)

In order to access features like an internet connection for linking to a github repository and uploading and downloading data sets, you will need to phone verify your account. Click on the icon in the top right and select account (The gear icon). Under "phone verification", enter your phone number and then enter the 6 digit code that was sent to your device.

### Step 2: Send me your username
The spacetime repository is private until it is fully developed. Email me your username (alexburn17@gmail.com) and I will give you access.

### Step 3: Access the repository 
You will be sent an email with a link to the repository. Click the blue button to access the kaggle workbook.

```
When you hit return, you should see the following loading screen:

### Step 5: Start using spacetime

The main script can now be edited and the functions listed in the API can now be used. 

The instance of the VM can be turned on and off and restarted if issues arrise by clicking the power button in the upper right. Code can be run block by block using the run bottons on the left.
