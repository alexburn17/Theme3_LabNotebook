Here I am playing with a package called Cubes in python. It is a lightweight OLAP cubes implementation with an sql back-end. I began by working through the tutorial but found that the library is no longer being maintained and will not work with newer python and sql alchemy. I could drop down to a previous version of python but I believe I will continue on another line to avoid this for now.
reticulate::repl_python()
