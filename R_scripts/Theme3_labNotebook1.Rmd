### Description:

Date created:  2 August 2021           
Author: P. Alexander Burnham

**Summary** This document follows my progress on Theme 3 in order to provide a location for me and other members of the team to keep track of this work and maintain annotated description and functioning examples of previous iterations and related vignettes. 


### 2 August 2021:

Here I load the GDAL library in python, read in raster files and figure out how to use the package to access the raster data.

```{r setup, include=T}


#load the reticulate package  
library(reticulate)

# activate my previously created conda 3.7 environment
use_condaenv(condaenv = "Python37Env", conda = "auto", required = FALSE)


```

Make sure my 3.7 conda env is loaded
```{python}

import platform

# make sure python 3.7 is laoded
print(platform.python_version())
```

```{python}

from osgeo import gdal
import glob
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import time

# set my absolute directory path for where the data are
direc ="/Users/pburnham/Documents/geospatialData/"

# create a list of all raster files that end in .tif
dataPaths = glob.glob(direc+"*.tif")
print(dataPaths)

timeList = len(dataPaths) # time dimension (three times: 1980-1982 inclusive)

# create raster data set from the second file in the list
ds = gdal.Open(dataPaths[1])
print(type(ds))



# retrieving important meta data info
print(ds.RasterXSize, ds.RasterYSize) # # get dims: 29484 x 33555
print(ds.GetProjection()) # get projection info
print("number of bands:", ds.RasterCount) # there is only one band as expected
print(ds.GetGeoTransform())  # get transform data (corners)


```

Convert to an array and plot
```{python}


# pull out the band
band = ds.GetRasterBand(1)

# # convert to a large numpy array - may not be the best way to handle things
myarray = np.array(band.ReadAsArray()) #(989,335,620 points on the map)
#
#
# # plt the array as a heat map
plt.imshow(myarray, cmap='hot', interpolation='nearest')
plt.show()

```

Out of curiosity, what is the clock time for dividing a 989 million cell vectorized division process on a numpy array on my m1 macbook.
```{python}
start = time.process_time()

# divide every cell in the array by 2
x = np.divide(myarray,2)

# print the run time
print("Running time in seconds:", time.process_time() - start)




```

### 3 August 2021
Here I am attempting to pull in multiple geotiff files and create a list of gdal data sets. I will then scale them to have the same resolution and use the same coordinate systems and measurement schemes. The goal is to use meters, default to EPSG:3857 and default to the highest common scale in terms of granularity. This can be changed in the future. I will use GDAL as it seems that this is the underlying library that is used in most other python geospatial libraries.

```{python}
from osgeo import gdal
import glob
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import time


# set my absolute directory path for where the data are
direc ="/Users/pburnham/Documents/geospatialData/"

# create a list of all raster files that end in .tif
dataPaths = glob.glob(direc+"*.tif")
#print(dataPaths)

timeList = len(dataPaths) # time dimension (three times: 1980-1982 inclusive)

# initialize a list to store files in during the loop
myDataList = [None] * timeList

# create a list of rasters
for t in range(0, timeList):
   myDataList[t] = gdal.Open(dataPaths[t])




##################################################################################################
# we have rasters of India using different coordinate systems, resulutions and slightly different cropeed frames
# here I will attempt to create a put them on a commmon coordinate system and scale

# print the transformes
print("Course Area:", myDataList[0].GetGeoTransform()) # file one us UTS scaled in degrees
print("Fine Population:", myDataList[1].GetGeoTransform()) # file two is using meters

# get projection info
print("Course Area:", myDataList[0].GetProjection())
print("Fine Population:", myDataList[1].GetProjection())


# initialize a list to store altered files
myDataListScaled = [None] * timeList

# create a list of rasters rescaled to EPSG:3857 with a common grid size
# the resulutions are hard-coded here. Will add flexability nect by picking max dim of all imported rasters
for t in range(0, timeList):
   myDataListScaled[t] = gdal.Warp('', myDataList[t], dstSRS='EPSG:3857', format='VRT',
   outputType=gdal.GDT_Int16,xRes=1052.2047247721555, yRes=-1052.2047247721555)

# reprint the transformes after allteration
print("Course Area:", myDataListScaled[0].GetGeoTransform()) # file one us UTS scaled in degrees
print("Fine Population:", myDataListScaled[1].GetGeoTransform()) # file two is using meters

```
