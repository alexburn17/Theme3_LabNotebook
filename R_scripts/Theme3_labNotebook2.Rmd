### Description:

Date created:  9 August 2021           
Author: P. Alexander Burnham

**Summary** This document follows my progress on Theme 3 in order to provide a location for me and other members of the team to keep track of this work and maintain annotated description and functioning examples of previous iterations and related vignettes. 


### 9 August 2021:

Here I load the GDAL library in python, read in raster files and figure out how to use the package to access the raster data.

```{r setup, include=T}


#load the reticulate package  
library(reticulate)

# activate my previously created conda 3.7 environment
use_condaenv(condaenv = "Python37Env", conda = "auto", required = FALSE)


```

Make sure my 3.7 conda env is loaded
```{python}

import platform

# make sure python 3.7 is laoded
print(platform.python_version())
```

```{python}

```
